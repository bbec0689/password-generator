# What I Did

* First I restructured the HTML to fit into a format where I could add checkboxes and a number slider

* Then I reformatted my CSS to match what I had changed in the index.

* After that I deleted the origing JS that was written and constructed my own.

* I also set up my arrays using charCodes
